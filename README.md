# Mini Shell

> [!NOTE]
> This project was created by me, as a learning exercise to explore and understand Rust, especially for building cross-platform CLI applications.

A cross-platform shell implementation written in Rust that provides basic file system operations and unified package management across different operating systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Core Shell Commands**: Familiar shell commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cat`, etc.
- **Unified Package Management**: Abstracts multiple package managers into a single interface
- **Smart Path Handling**: Supports absolute, relative, and `~` home directory paths
- **Colored Output**: Color-coded directory listings where supported
- **System Command Execution**: Run any system command directly

pkg list               - List available package managers
```
